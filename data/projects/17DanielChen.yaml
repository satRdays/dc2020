abstractTitle: "Grading Code with `gradethis`"
abstract: "I was lucky to be selected as one of the summer 2019 inters for RStudio. I worked on the `gradethis` package, which aimed to grade code in a `learnr` document. The real magic of the package isn’t just reporting a correct or incorrect answer, it’s the ability to provide meaningful feedback to the learner. For example: 'I expected a call to `log` where you put `exp`, next time's the charm!'<br>In the process, I developed a lot of skills that turned me from a mere user of R to a developer. This talk will cover the basics of the `gradethis` package, how you might go about using it in a `learnr` document or in a self-contained nature, and then I'll go over some of the things I learned during my internship (expressions, tidyeval, robust code, documentation templates) with some of the code within the package."
