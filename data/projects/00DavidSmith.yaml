abstractTitle: "20 Years of R"
abstract: "Version 1.0.0 of R was released to the world on February 29, 2000, and had already had a significant impact on statistical data analysis software even at that point. In this talk, I'll look back on the history of the R project: its predecessor, S; the open-source movement and its connection with R; its growth in academic and research communities; and its adoption by commercial enterprises."
