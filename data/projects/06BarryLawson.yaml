abstractTitle: "simEd: An R Package for Simulation Education"
abstract: "This talk will discuss the 'SimEd' package for R, intended for use in an undergraduate or introductory graduate-level simulation course.   The package includes functions for generating discrete and continuous variates via inversion, with capabilities for independent streams and antithetic variates; for visualizing inversion in variate generation and the relationship to the pdf/pmf, cdf, and ecdf; for computing time-persistent statistics; for extensible single- and multiple-server queueing simulation; and includes data sets for input modeling and analysis.  We will also debut new additions coming soon to the R package, including detailed animation of an event-driven queuing simulation model, visualization of a multiplicative Lehmer random number generator, and visualization of various random variate generation techniques."
