abstractTitle: "Saving 1000 hours with R"
abstract: "Imagine going into the office and all your daily, weekly or monthly reports that used to take you hours have been generated for your review; Imagine internal customers no longer need to wait for your data department to pull data or create data reports. With RStudio in place, you no longer need to imagine that. At CARFAX, we switched our analysis tool from SAS to R a couple of years ago. I have initiated an Automation project at CARFAX that saved over 1200 work hours. In this talk, I will talk about the project, the lessons learned and the sustainable workflow."
