abstractTitle: "Learning more from direct-to-consumer personal genome data"
abstract: "Currently, there are dozens of companies that offer direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests to the general public for various reports. Some of these DTC companies also provide customers with raw data. In this talk, I will go through my experience of analyzing my own genome using data from some of these companies. I will show how one can use R and other tools to perform custom analysis to learn more from their genome, such as their ancestry or predicted cancer predisposition. I will also present some simple ways to confirm that the data you received is indeed your own genome. Finally, because DTC genetic data came from Saliva, I will explain how you can use this data to find what you just ate and what oral microbiome you might have."
